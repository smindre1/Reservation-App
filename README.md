### To Do:
- The React HTML file needs a favicon/browser icon.
    - The public/vite.svg directory and file can be deleted once the icon is updated.
- The React README.md file should be updated.
- When deploying on netlify, don't forget to add the netlify configurations for react router dom (multiple webpages).
